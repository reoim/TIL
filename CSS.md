## Difference between id and class
In terms of syntax, they work exactly same except that id use \# and class use \. infront of name.

However,

**id**s are unique

* Each element can have only one id
* Each page can have only one element with that id

**class**es are NOT unique

* You can use the same class on multiple elements.
* You can use multiple classes on the same element.

**Javascript cares**

JavaScript depends on there being only one page element with any particular id, or else the commonly used getElementById function couldn't be depended on.
