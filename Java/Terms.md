### JAAS 
Java Authentication and Authorization Service, or JAAS, pronounced "Jazz" is the Java implementation of the standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) information security framework.
JAAS was introduced as an extension library to the Java Platform, Standard Edition 1.3 and was integrated in version 1.4.

JAAS has as its main goal the separation of concerns of user authentication so that they may be managed independently. 
While the former authentication mechanism contained information about where the code originated from and who signed that code, 
JAAS adds a marker about who runs the code. By extending the verification vectors JAAS extends the security architecture for Java applications that require authentication and authorization modules.
