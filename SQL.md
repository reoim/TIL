## Insert subquery values
Subqueries are not allowed in (INSERT INTO ... VALUES...) context. Only scalar expressions are allowed.

In order to use subquery, use (INSERT INTO ... SELECT) instead.

e.g>
```sql
INSERT INTO tableName(ID, column1)
SELECT
	NEWID(),
	(SELECT TOP 1 columnName
	FROM otherTable
	WHERE (condition..)
	
```
----

## Subquery returned more than 1 value
This is not permitted when the subquery follows =, !=, <, <= , >, >= or when the subquery is used as an expression. 

e.g> Following SQL query doesn't work
```sql
INSERT INTO table(ID, column1, column2)
SELECT
	NEWID(),
	(SELECT column3
	FROM otherTable
	WHERE column3 = 'value'), 'test'
```
Because the subquery returns multiple values and it try to insert multiple value into 1 row. The query should be changed like this. 

```sql
INSERT INTO table(ID, column1, column2)
SELECT NEWID(),column3, 'test'
FROM otherTable
WHERE column3 = 'value'
```
In this case, I can insert multiple value from subquery with new unique ID and 'test' value to column2.

## SELECT DISTINCT comparability
**SELECT DISTINCT statement** is to return only different value when there are duplicated values in a column.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name,column_name
FROM table_name;
```
**Comparability error**

**Text / nText / image** data type cannot be selected as **DISTINCT** because it is not comparable.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CAST(Description as TEXT)
FROM PRODUCTS
```
Cannot cast Description column as text when use **DISTINCT**.

It will get following error message.
```
Msg 421, Level 16, State 1, Line 1
The text data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT because it is not comparable.
```
Use varchar(max) instead of text.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CAST(Description as varchar(50))
FROM PRODUCTS
```

----

## Put column name to CAST

Following sql returns values without column name.
```sql
SELECT CAST(column1 as varchar(50))
FROM table1
```
Add **'as columnName'** after **')'**
```sql
SELECT CAST(column1 as varchar(50)) as columnName
FROM table1
```

----

## Return row number for each row

Example code
```sql
USE AdventureWorks2012;   
GO  
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY SalesYTD DESC) AS Row,   
    FirstName, LastName, ROUND(SalesYTD,2,1) AS "Sales YTD"   
FROM Sales.vSalesPerson  
WHERE TerritoryName IS NOT NULL AND SalesYTD <> 0;  
```

Result
```
Row FirstName    LastName               SalesYTD

## SELECT * does not work on mssql

```sql
select * from table //error

select column1, column2 from table //works fine
```
It happens when MSSQL table has **TEXT** type column and blank string in it.

#### How to solve the problem?
* Change the datatype of that column to varchar 
* Reset the value of the column from blank string to NULL
* Select only necessary columns

----

## SELECT TEXT type with blank string
Similar issue with above one. You can not select text type column with balnk string in it.

In this case, Change data type or Cast it as varchar.
```sql
select CAST(column1 as varchar(50)) from table
```

## MySQL Limit clause in MS SQL server
MySQL Limit is convenient and easy to use.
```sql
SELECT 
    column1,column2,...
FROM
    table
LIMIT offset , count;
```

MSSQL does not have Limit clause. But it can be achived by following query
```sql
WITH Results_CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        Col1, Col2, ...,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SortCol1, SortCol2, ...) AS RowNum
    FROM Table
    WHERE <whatever>
)
SELECT *
FROM Results_CTE
WHERE RowNum >= @Offset
AND RowNum < @Offset + @Limit
```
or you can use **BETWEEN** as well.
```sql
WITH Results_CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        Col1, Col2, ...,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SortCol1, SortCol2, ...) AS RowNum
    FROM Table
    WHERE <whatever>
)
SELECT *
FROM Results_CTE
WHERE RowNum BETWEEN @Offset AND @Offset+@Limit
```
Also you can use **NOT IN**.
```sql
SELECT TOP @limit col1 FROM table WHERE primaryCol not in (SELECT TOP @offset primaryCol FROM table)
```
